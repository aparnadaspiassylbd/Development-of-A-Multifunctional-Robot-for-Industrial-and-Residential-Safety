# Development-of-A-Multifunctional-Robot-for-Industrial-and-Residential-Safety
Accidents are on the rise in today's world. An accident may potentially cause the loss of many lives, valuable properties, or sometimes may lead to permanent disability to the victim. New and improved technologies are being used to prevent these accidents. In this paper, we have proposed a multipurpose rescue robot that will minimize the damage of the accidents like fire hazards, building collapse, deadly gas leakage, etc. This project aims to ensure the safety of our lives and valuable properties by minimizing the damages that occurred from any accident.
